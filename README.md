# README powerindices
This package computes 
the **Penrose Banzhaf index (PBI)**, 
the **Shapley Shubik index (SSI)**, and 
the **Coleman Shapley index (CSI)**
for weighted voting games. 
Both, quota and weights must be **integers**.
Moreover, it is possible to give an optional arguemnent: the minimal size of a winning coalition.

For information about the indices:

## Installation
If you haven't installed python yet, get it, e.g. from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. 

*Option 1*: To install the tool, run `pip install powerindices` in your terminal. If you use anaconda, run the command in the [Anaconda Promt](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-the-anaconda-command-prompt).

*Option 2 (without installation)*: It's just one file, so that an installation of the powerindices package isn't actually necessary: Just download the repository and copy powerindices.py to your working folder.  (Or have the files example.py and powerindices.py in the same folder. Then, running the example.py will compute the indices for the UN Security Council.)



## Usage
This [example.py](https://github.com/frankhuettner/powerindices/blob/master/example.py) offers the following examples. 
#### The powerindices for the UN Security Council
```
import powerindices
quota,weights = 39, [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
# call the functions compute_pbi, compute_csi, or compute_SSi to compute the corresponding index
PBIs = powerindices.compute_pbi(quota,weights)
SSIs = powerindices.compute_ssi(quota,weights)
CSIs = powerindices.compute_csi(quota,weights)
### The functions return the indices as lists so that
### they are now stored as lists in the PBIs, SSIs, and CSIs.
### We could simply print these list:
print(SSIs)
print(PBIs)
print(CSIs)
```
Here, the quota is set to 39 and the weights are [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
where the veto powers are thought to have 7 and the nonpermanent members have weight 1. 
Alternatively, set quota = 5, weights = [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and pass the optional argument `minimalWinningCoalitionSize=10`:
```
import powerindices
quota,weights = 5, [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 
# call the functions compute_pbi, compute_csi, or compute_SSi to compute the corresponding index
PBIs = powerindices.compute_pbi(quota,weights,minimalWinningCoalitionSize=9)
SSIs = powerindices.compute_ssi(quota,weights,minimalWinningCoalitionSize=9)
CSIs = powerindices.compute_csi(quota,weights,minimalWinningCoalitionSize=9)
```

#### The powerindices for the EU Council (needs to be uncommented)
This can be computed as well: the quota is 65% of the population and the weight of every country is the population of this country. Moreover, the minimal size of a winning coalition must be specified: setting `minimalWinningCoalitionSize=16` ensures that only coalitions with at least 16 members (i.e., 55% of the countries) are winning. For details, see the [example.py](https://github.com/frankhuettner/powerindices/blob/master/example.py) file.

## Usage from within R
You can use this tool from within R by help of [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate). To this end,
* Install the package *powerindices* in your python environment running the command `pip install powerindices` in your terminal.
* Install [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate).
* Call the package *powerindices* from within R and make sure to send integers, e.g., the following will store the CSIs for the UN Security Council in the list `csis`
    ```
    library(reticulate)
    powerindices <- import("powerindices")
    csis <-powerindices$compute_csi(39L,c(7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L))
    ```
## Requirements
You need to have numpy and math. I did not put it into the setup.py requirements because this seems to bring trouble. Both packages are standard and come with anaconda.

## Used algorithm
We use an algorithm following that counts the number of swings of a voter, see e.g.,
> S. Kurz: Computing the Power Distribution in the IMF ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01443)).
