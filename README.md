# powerindices
This package computes 
the Penrose Banzhaf index (PBI), 
the Shapley Shubik index (SSI), and 
the Coleman Shapley index (CSI)
for weighted voting games. 
Both, quota and weights must be **integers**.


For information about the indices:
PBI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf_power_index
SSI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Shubik_power_index
CSI: a paper soon available by Andre Casajus and Frank Huettner

# Installation
